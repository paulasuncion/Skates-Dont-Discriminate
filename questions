Radio buttons; if when selecting a button, is it possible to unclick that button and it'll show that it has been unselected? Or is this type of button meant to stay selected?
while I am creating different branches, when I merge them all to the main branch, will it move the syntax/code onto my main branch as well? Or would i have to copy and paste it?
